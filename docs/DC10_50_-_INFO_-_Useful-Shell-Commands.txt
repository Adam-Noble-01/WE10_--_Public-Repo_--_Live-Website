## File Operations

### Batch Rename Files
To rename multiple files by replacing a prefix (e.g., changing 'AD' to 'DC'):
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "AD10_*" | ForEach-Object { Rename-Item -Path $_.FullName -NewName ($_.Name -replace '^AD', 'DC') }
```

This command:
1. `Get-ChildItem -Path "AD10_*"` - Gets all files starting with "AD10_"
2. `ForEach-Object { ... }` - Processes each file
3. `Rename-Item` - Renames each file
4. `-replace '^AD', 'DC'` - Replaces 'AD' at the start of the filename with 'DC'

Note: Make sure you're in the correct directory before running the command.
