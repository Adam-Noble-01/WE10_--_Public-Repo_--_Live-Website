-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
04-Apr-2025 - Version 1.0
- This file is a strict set of rules for the CSS naming conventions used in the application.
- All CSS files must be named using this convention.
=======================================================================================================================


# CORE CONVENTIONS |  CSS NAMING STANDARDS 
- Must always be consistently used accross entire application.
- Uses a 3 level structure
    -Note | Whilst similar to BIM in 3 layer structure, Case standards are unique to this project.
        - Block Level      =    
        - Elemnent Level   =  
        - Modifier Level   =  


### STANDARDS |  Block-Level Component Style Naming Conventions
- Always uses a 4 Leter code to define the block type.
- Used to delinate the broad type and scopt that the style is applied to

| CODE | VERBOSE DESCRIPTION | FULL DESCRIPTION                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HEAD | Application Header  | Elements grouped within the header bar section at the top of the application. |
| FOOT | Application Footer  | Elements grouped within the footer section at the bottom of the application.  |
| MENU | Menu UI Blocks      | Broadly defines the style block level for any menu type in the application.   |

### CSS Formatting Code Block Format Breakdown

#### Objective

Create visually organized and consistent CSS code with standardized spacing for improved readability.

#### Required Format

-   Each CSS property-value pair should be aligned with consistent spacing
-   Headers should be centered and surrounded by hyphens
-   Colons should be aligned based on the longest property name
-   Values should be aligned to start at the same position
-   Comments should have consistent spacing

#### Key Structuring Rules

**Headers**: Centre text and surround with hyphens , aim for a line length of 80 Chars 
    ```css
    /* - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Header Text   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - */
    ```
**Property Names**  :  Right-align and pad with spaces to match the longest property
**Colons**    :  Add 4 spaces after each property name, followed by the colon
**Values**    :  Add 4 spaces after each colon before the value
**Comments**  :  Add 4 spaces after each value before inline comments

----

### Examples 

###### Example: Incorrect Format
```css
/* Specific Button Styles */
.BTNS__item--code {
   background-color: var(--primary-color);
   position: absolute; /* Position code copy button */
   top: 10px; 
   right: 10px;
   opacity: 0.7; /* Make it less intrusive */
   z-index: 5; 
}
```


###### Example: Correct Format
```css
/* - - - - - - - - - - -   Styles for the <code> element   - - - - - - - - - - */
.BTNS__item--code {
   background-color    :    var(--primary-color);    /* <-- Always space comments 4x space */
   position            :    absolute;                /* <-- From the longest value */
   top                 :    10px; 
   right               :    10px;
   opacity             :    0.7;
   z-index             :    5; 
}
```

-   Using the formatting shown above creates a clean & grid-like structure.
-   This makes that makes CSS properties and values easier to scan and maintain.
-   Readability should be prioritised over lean code.
