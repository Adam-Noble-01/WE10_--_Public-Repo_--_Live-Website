## Task

- You are going to help me modularise the project
- We need to break up the codebase
- We need to ensure separation of concerns 
- The Codebase is  too unwieldy currently

Analyse the FULL Codebase and give me a outline of the key sections we could carve the script into

-   I stress you must READ THE CODEBASE IN ITS ENTIRETY



---

We are going to go one by one

We pick alement to rip from the main @NA20_WebApp_-_PlanVision_-_Core-Index-File.html 

Then we move it into the relevent .js file in src

Start with the simplest, I will test each time we move a code section to a new script file

You must be careful and methodical
