========================================================

COMPLETED TASKS

  - Created Revision Notes to track version history
- Created modular CSS file with updated naming conventions
- Created modular JavaScript files:
  - App-Assets-Loader.js: Loads core application assets

  - URL-Parser.js: Handles URL construction and parsing
  - Measurement-Scaling.js: Manages measurement scale calculations
  - Measurement-Tools.js: Implements measurement tool functionality

  - Application-Controller.js: Coordinates between all modules
  - Module-Integration.js: Provides integration between modules
  - Font-Asset-Loader.js: Loads fonts from centralized asset library

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Created a Module-Integration.js file to properly connect the Project Assets Loader with the Canvas Renderer
- Fixed the render loop to properly display loaded images
- Enhanced the Canvas Renderer with improved image handling and rendering capabilities
- Updated events system to ensure proper communication between modules
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the application
- Enhanced debugging capabilities:
  - Added comprehensive Debug Panel with tabbed interface
  - Implemented real-time status monitoring for Canvas Renderer and Asset Loading
  - Added detailed error tracking by module with timestamps
  - Created diagnostic tools to test image loading and rendering pipeline
  - Added application state monitoring with periodic status updates
- Implemented consistent naming convention across all files:
  - Standardized DOM element IDs using Block__Element pattern (e.g., CNVS__Plan)
  - Ensured CSS selectors match HTML element IDs consistently
  - Updated all JavaScript module references to use the same IDs
  - Fixed cross-module dependencies to maintain consistency
- Implemented distinct rendering architecture with separation of concerns:
  - Canvas Renderer: Focused on image rendering, view transformations, and draw loops
  - Canvas Controller: Handles user interactions, pan/zoom animations, and touch support
  - Module-Integration: Coordinates communication between rendering and asset modules
- Implemented centralized font loading system:
  - Created dedicated Font-Asset-Loader.js to fetch fonts from asset library
  - Dynamically generates @font-face declarations from centralized JSON data
  - Ensures consistent typography across the application
  - Properly handles font weights for UI elements
  - Provides fallback fonts for error situations

RENDERING ARCHITECTURE
- Split rendering responsibilities between two complementary modules:
  - Canvas Renderer:
    - Primary responsibility: Efficient drawing and rendering operations
    - Manages the main render loop for smooth frame updates
    - Handles image placement, scaling, and view transformations
    - Provides methods for external modules to update canvas content
    - Exposes direct viewState object for debugging and manipulation
  - Canvas Controller:
    - Primary responsibility: User interaction handling
    - Manages pan, zoom, and touch interactions with smooth animations
    - Implements specialized touch handling for mobile devices
    - Controls fullscreen mode and view resets
    - Provides clean public API for other modules to use
  - These are not duplicates but complementary components that work together:
    - Renderer focuses on "what to draw" (drawing operations)
    - Controller focuses on "how to interact" (user input)
    - Module-Integration coordinates between these components

CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED
- Script Loading Order Issue:
  - Problem: Images weren't loading on the canvas because scripts were loading in an incorrect order
  - Symptoms: Canvas remained blank despite successful image URL extraction and HTTP requests
  - Root Cause: Module dependencies were broken by improper script sequencing
  - Fix: Reorganized script loading order to respect module dependencies
    - Moved Module-Integration before the modules it integrates
    - Placed Application-Controller early to coordinate initialization
    - Grouped scripts logically (utilities, coordination, assets, rendering, UI, debug)
    - Established clear dependency flow from utilities to implementation
  - Lesson Learned: Script loading order is critical in modular applications
    - Coordination modules must load before what they coordinate
    - Clear dependency chain must be maintained in HTML source order
    - Proper module initialization sequence is essential for event-driven architecture

- Image Loading Enhancement:
  - Improved image loading process with better error handling and debugging
  - Added direct notification system using custom events
  - Added detailed logging and visualization of canvas state
  - Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for image loading failures
  - Enhanced canvas size detection to prevent zero-dimensional rendering surfaces

- Button Styling Issues:
  - Problem: Buttons were using inconsistent styling with overly bold text
  - Symptoms: UI elements had varying typography and didn't match design standards
  - Root Cause: Incorrect font weight was being applied without a systematic approach
  - Fix: Implemented standardized button styling across the application
    - Created typography variables in CSS for consistent font handling
    - Applied SemiBold (600) weight to buttons instead of Bold (700)
    - Updated all button classes to use the same styling pattern
    - Added proper transitions and hover/active states
  - Lesson Learned: Font weight has a significant impact on UI readability
    - Consistent typography requires proper font loading and weight control
    - CSS variables help maintain consistency across complex applications

CURRENT STATUS
- Basic application structure is in place with modular components
- Assets are being loaded correctly
- Render loop is operational and displaying loaded drawings
- Advanced debugging tools are available for troubleshooting rendering issues
- CSS and HTML integration issues have been resolved
- All modules now consistently reference the same DOM elements
- Fonts are now loaded from the centralized asset library
- Button styling has been standardized across the application

DEBUGGING TOOLS
- Debug Panel now includes:
  - Log tab displaying all console output
  - Status tab with real-time system information
  - Detailed error reporting by module
  - Visual indicators for module initialization status
  - Canvas renderer and asset loading state monitoring
- The following commands are available in the browser console:
  - window.debugPanel.testImageLoadingFlow() - Test image loading and rendering pipeline
  - window.debugPanel.inspectRendererState() - Log current renderer state
  - window.debugPanel.show()/hide() - Control debug panel visibility

NAMING CONVENTION
- Implemented a three-tier naming system for DOM elements:
  - BLOCK__Element: Main structural elements (e.g., CNVS__Plan, TOOL__Container)
  - .TYPE__Variant: Classes for styling patterns (e.g., .BTTN__Tool, .MENU__Drawing-Header-Text)
  - #ID__Specific: Unique identifiers for specific elements (e.g., #BTTN__Reset-View)
- This convention ensures:
  - Clear visual distinction between IDs, classes, and standard HTML elements
  - Logical grouping of related UI components
  - Improved maintainability and readability

TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM
- Implemented a comprehensive typography system using CSS variables:
  - Font families defined as variables (--font-family-primary, --font-family-handwritten)
  - Standardized font weights (normal: 400, medium: 500, semibold: 600, bold: 700)
  - Dynamic loading of fonts from the centralized asset library
  - Consistent application of typography across all UI elements
- Benefits:
  - Improved readability and visual consistency
  - Better maintainability through centralized font definitions
  - Proper fallbacks for all font resources
  - Simplified updates to typography across the application

NEXT STEPS
- Test measurement tools with the new modular structure
- Ensure markup tools function correctly
- Complete UI elements and navigation
- Add remaining features from the original app
- Complete thorough testing across different browsers
