## Task

I'm in the process of offloading This giant @main.js into smaller more manigible scripts

I've partially built a @canvas-utilities.js  script but it needs completing and all functions correctly linking back to the new script

TASK ONE 
\- You must go through the ENTIRE @main.js script (dont search for sections etc) read it line for line
\- Mark each section with a comment if its related to canvas utilites 

TASK TWO 
\- Double check all methods and functions are accounted for

TASK THREE
\- Offload them into @canvas-utilities.js from @main.js 

TASK FOUR 
\- Validate call statements
\- Double check everything carefully

\----

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
\- Speed is no issue, accuracy is key
\- Check everything logically, donty make assumptions
