# STYLE GUIDE & BREAKDOWN  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## INDUSTRY CONTEXT

### Visual Identity Relevance
-   Noble Architecture Pictogram Design
-   All pictograms clearly belong within the British Architectural & Construction Industry, specifically:
    - Residential architectural design
    - Planning and technical stages
    - Client-facing project timelines or web interfaces
-   The aesthetic should generally convey project sequencing representing design stage markers
-   Suitable for a practice offering RIBA-inspired service stage breakdowns for clients.

### Where Are To Be Used
- All Noble Architecture projects
- All Noble Architecture Web Applications
- All Noble Architecture Web Pages
- Client Portal Interfaces
- Digital client dashboards
- Explainer sections in architectural proposals
- Web-based Design Stage Walkthroughs & Guide documents and pages.
- Stage headers in PDF or print design packs

# STYLE GUIDE  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OVERALL FORMAT

### Canvas
- **Shape**: Circular badge  
- **Background**: Pure white (`#FFFFFF`)
- **Border**: Uniform round stroke, medium-weight, muted brown/grey tone (`#726C64` approx.)

### Composition
- Centre-aligned line illustration
- Equal margin within the circle for all elements (approx. 10–15% padding)
- Negative space used generously for legibility and visual hierarchy

---

## COLOUR PALETTE

| Element           | Colour       | HEX Code   |
|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| Linework & Icons  | Taupe Grey   | `#726C64`  |
| Background        | White        | `#FFFFFF`  |
| Shadow / Depth    | None         | –          |

---

## TYPOGRAPHY
- **None used within the icons themselves** – pure pictographic clarity.
- Any accompanying text would likely use clean modern sans-serif such as **Open Sans**, matching Adam's preferences.

---

## LINE STYLE

- **Weight**: Uniform stroke weight (approx. 2–3px in 768x768 canvas)
- **Ends**: Square caps, no rounded corners
- **Style**: Minimalist outline with occasional filled detail elements (e.g. stamp in Approved Form icon)

---

## STYLE PRINCIPLES

- **Neutral tone** for broad professional use
- **Scalable** clarity (works at small and large sizes)
- **Non-directional** (no strong shadows or gradients)
- **Stylised realism**: Enough recognisability to communicate the concept, but abstracted to feel universal


# REPRODUCTION STEPS  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Create Canvas
- Open artboard |  Artboard Size = 1500px x 1500px
- Draw a white circle, centre it, and apply a stroke (`#726C64`, 3px)

### Step 2: Draw Icon
- Use line tool / shape tool only (no raster effects)
- Keep within central ~80% of canvas
- Ensure icon is vertically and horizontally balanced

### Step 3: Export
- Format: SVG (preferred for scalability), PNG fallback
- Background: Transparent or white depending on usage

## VECTOR DRAWING SETUP (Illustrator or Figma)
## CANVAS SETUP

### Dimensions
- **Size**: 1500 x 1500 px
- **Shape**: Circle with filled background and thin outline stroke

### Grid / Margins
- Internal grid for alignment: 12x12 with central focus
- Margin around artwork: 80–100 px from circle edge

---

### Line Settings
- Stroke Weight: `3 px`
- Stroke Colour: `#726C64`
- No fills unless needed for semantic accent (e.g. stamp handle)
