##### Remove Parent Islands

Next to the detect elements button I would like to add a new toggle that allows you to unify all smaller islands with the bigger islands they might be contained within because if you look at the image what's happening is the watercolour painting that I'm testing the tool on it has reflections brushed onto the glass panes and what's happening is within the same pane 2 islands are being detected and what this is doing if you look at the image is a smaller one is sometimes inside of a larger 1 so if an island is detected within a larger island and is completely surrounded by the larger island it should just be absorbed into the bigger one to stop multiple levels being rendered on top of each other it should always be the biggest one that absorbs the smaller ones and this should mean that it after being rendered showing the detection also means the smaller ones don't affect the final geometry generation either so the toggle effects both stages it ensures that the smaller islands that are fully contained within the larger detections don't make it and can be eliminated
