##### Remove Parent Islands

Next to the detect elements button I would like to add a new toggle that allows you to unify all smaller islands with the bigger islands they might be contained within because if you look at the image what's happening is the watercolour painting that I'm testing the tool on it has reflections brushed onto the glass panes and what's happening is within the same pane 2 islands are being detected and what this is doing if you look at the image is a smaller one is sometimes inside of a larger 1 so if an island is detected within a larger island and is completely surrounded by the larger island it should just be absorbed into the bigger one to stop multiple levels being rendered on top of each other it should always be the biggest one that absorbs the smaller ones and this should mean that it after being rendered showing the detection also means the smaller ones don't affect the final geometry generation either so the toggle effects both stages it ensures that the smaller islands that are fully contained within the larger detections don't make it and can be eliminated



#### Add Detection Step Merge Close Points

Now on the detection panel add a merge close points slider 

If users scale input is less than 
\- 1000mm Then merge range = 0 - 25mm (Range that the slider allows for 
1000mm - 5000mm = Range of 0 - 50mm
5000mm - 10000mm + = Range of 0 - 100mm

This allows for some cleanup and should close some of the rougue holes and joints still p[resent aiding before the inerpolation into clean geometry in the secon setion

Study the image

the merge vertices function is all messed up just setting A2 millimetre distance completely screws up the merging.

Study both of the images study both of the images very very closely because if you see one of them I've got the merge set to 0 it's the last slider on the first section and there are lots of edges that are close to each other and you can see them up against each other where you have two shapes and a jagged line between the two this is what I'm trying to fuse so I made that last slider but after rigging it up and plugging some new functions into the script all it does is make massive sections triangulate so is it allowing for the correct scaling etcetera is there a better implementation we can do of this because it's not merging close filled shapes with one another it should only work where you have the boundaries and pull the vertices from each shape into the middle average point based on that distance so if they are both within 10 millimetres of each other it will merge them both to the five millimetre point in between getting rid of all of the sseems you can see



---

Carefully and logically go through this code I have inherited the first detection algorithms I have written and it's a two-stage process but I'm convinced a lot of the second stage where actually takes the input from The detection, the intention was supposed to be there the second set of tools and algorithms allow you to interpolate and further refine organized structure and normalize any inconsistencies from the first initial detection stage.

What I would like you to do is carefully look for the second stage and look for any clear placeholders or LAX in logic because it just doesn't seem to do much versus the first there seems to be huge gaps in any of the tools actually working or doing anything I want you to give you the logic first to look at this before we get looking at all the event and listeners and all of that kind of stuff I wanted to see if there's anything wrong with the core hardcore logic for the pipeline of the second set tools



Second Stage - Process & Refinements To Geometry For Export

-   This step takes the input from The detection.

-   The has a secondary  set of of tools allowing users to interpolate and further refine the geometry.

-   This ensure the final shapes are more structured and the normalised geometry.

-   This removes any inconsistencies from the first initial detection stage.

-   This ensures the geometry is ready for a CAD Enviroment.

## Overview Of Stage 2 Logic Gaps

Below is a careful review of the "Stage 2: Polygon Refinement" section (the `generatePolygons()` function and its helpers) highlighting where it might be failing to add meaningful refinement beyond Stage 1. Although the code is not "broken," there are several places where the logic is either too simplistic, configured with narrow edge cases, or includes partial/placeholder-like approaches that might not accomplish the intended “refinement” goals.

---

### Main Observations



#### Bridging Logic Is Rudimentary And does Nothing

- The bridging routine (`bridgeVertices(points, thresholdPixels)`) attempts to find pairs of points within a certain distance, then removes all intermediate vertices. This can be helpful for short, noise-like edge fragments but has some major limitations:

-   It only triggers if any two points are *strictly* within the specified threshold distance. If threshold is too small, it will never fire; if it is too large, you risk removing critical geometry.
-   The bridging logic can remove large swaths of points in one go (it literally splices everything between those two points). For typical architectural contours, you may rarely have pairs of points that close unless the shape is extremely small or the threshold is artificially high.
-   After bridging, you could easily end up with a degenerate polygon (fewer than 3 points). The code then rejects that shape outright. This can make bridging appear to do “nothing” if the result is always too small to remain valid.



#### Corner Closing Only Targets Very Small Segments

-   The corner closing routine (`closeCorners(points, thresholdPixels)`) only applies when:
-   Both segments adjoining the corner are shorter than `thresholdPixels`.
-   Those segments are near 90° to one another (dot product near zero).
-   Because it also depends on the segment lengths being smaller than the threshold, it effectively *ignores* normal-to-long edges. If Stage 1 produces corners where lines are more than a few dozen pixels in length, it is unlikely the threshold check will pass.
-   In many architectural drawings, corners can be quite large. Therefore, you might never see a “closed corner” happen unless you zoom in and set the threshold high enough to treat the segments as “short.” This can mislead one into thinking the corner logic is never firing or is incomplete.



#### 4. “Straightness Threshold” May Filter Out Too Much

-   The Stage 2 code does a final bounding-box “solidity” check:
    -   `solidity = polygonArea / boundingBoxArea`
    -   If `solidity < straightnessThreshold`, the shape is rejected.
-   This is effectively measuring how fully the polygon occupies its bounding box. If the user’s shapes are not fairly rectangular or if the bounding box is large but the actual shape is quite skinny, the shape might end up being excluded.
-   If the `straightnessThreshold` is high (e.g., 0.8 or 0.9), large or elongated polygons can get rejected despite being valid. Conversely, if it’s too low, you keep everything.
-   If the shape count after Stage 2 is always zero (or very low), it may look like the refinement “does nothing,” when in reality shapes are being systematically excluded.



### 5. No Iterative Reprocessing Or Additional Normalisation Steps

-   Stage 2’s bridging and corner-closing functions are each called just once, and the code ends there. If the shapes are still “rough” after that single pass, there is no second iteration or more nuanced smoothing approach.
-   You might expect something like repeated approximation or dynamic “snap to orthogonal or diagonal.” That does not exist here—only the single `approxPolyDP` pass (with `epsilonFactor`) plus bridging/corner checks.

6. Potential Placeholders Or Unfinished Approaches

-   Functions like `bridgeVertices` and `closeCorners` appear somewhat placeholder-like:
    -   `bridgeVertices` is a straightforward distance-based removal approach, but it does not handle bridging longer edges, partial bridging, or actual line “interpolation.” It is basically “if these two points are close, remove everything in between.”
    -   `closeCorners` handles only short, near-90° angles. This might be an incomplete approach if you wanted to systematically “square up” corners of all lengths.
-   There is no direct re-check for perfect orthogonal snapping, which would likely be more relevant to an architectural “Stage 2 normalisation.”



### Specific Points Of Potential “Lax Logic”

#### Bridging Routine

-   Only checks pairs of points (i, j) that are at least two indices apart. Any overlap with adjacency or near adjacency is skipped. This might be too strict to create bridging.
-   Removal of everything between those points can drastically reduce the polygon, sometimes rendering it invalid. If you see nothing happen, it may be because bridging tries to remove so much that the resulting polygon is <3 points, so it gets discarded.



#### Corner Closing Routine

-   Requires both adjacent edges to be smaller than `thresholdPixels`, and the angle near 90°, which rarely happens in typical architectural elements if the threshold is not carefully set.
-   The user might have believed they were “closing corners” for large corners. The logic here actually never tries to alter big edges.



#### Snapping Routine

-   The grid snapping uses `snapGridSizeMm` and simply `rounds()` each vertex to the nearest grid coordinate. This does not forcibly straighten lines, maintain uniform edge spacing, or unify angles. If the user expected that snapping would produce perfect rectangles or tidy geometry, that is not guaranteed.



#### ApproxPolyDP Epsilon Handling

-   The final contour approximation is governed by `epsilonFactor * perimeter`. If the user’s `epsilonFactor` is too small, the shape hardly changes. If it is too large, the shape becomes too crude or is discarded.
-   Coupled with bridging/corner checks, you might see either no effect (if thresholds are all small) or too much effect (if bridging/corner thresholds are large and end up removing everything).



#### Overzealous Rejection Criteria

-   The final bounding rectangle test, area-based “straightness,” and min/max dimension checks all come together in a single pass. It is easy for a contour to fail one of these criteria and silently vanish. That can give the impression that Stage 2 does “nothing” (all shapes are thrown away).

##### Summary Of Why Stage 2 “Doesn’t Seem To Do Much”



-   **Most of the advanced orthogonal logic remains in Stage 1.** 
-   Stage 2’s bridging and corner closing are partial or rely on thresholds that might not commonly be met.



-   **Several “rejection” checks** (solidity, bounding-box size, vertex count after bridging) can remove a large number of contours.



-   **No repeated or iterative pass** for smoothing/simplification – a single pass can fail to show a big difference.



-   **Corner closing** is limited to small edges near 90° – large corners or more general perpendicular edges get ignored.



-   **Bridging** is essentially a “remove everything in between two close points” approach; might be too blunt or never triggered.



---



### Possible Next Steps / Improvements

-   **Integrate Orthogonal Bias In Stage 2**: Re-run an `orthogonalizeContour`-like function with stricter snapping for near-rectilinear geometry.



-   **Allow Larger Corner Closing**: Instead of requiring both edges to be under a short threshold, measure angles on the entire polygon and snap corners that are near 90° no matter the edge length.



-   **Refine Bridging**: Instead of removing every vertex in between two points, create an algorithm that merges just a small portion or linearly interpolates. Also consider bridging small gaps that exist between the end of one polygon piece and the start of another.



-   **Review “Straightness Threshold”**: Switch from a bounding-box-based solidity check to a more geometry-savvy measure if your shapes are more varied or triangular.



-   **Iterative Or Multi-pass Approach**: Re-run bridging and corner closing repeatedly until changes stabilise. This is common in advanced polygon smoothing routines.



By adjusting thresholds, refining bridging logic, and making corner closing handle normal-sized edges, you will likely see Stage 2 have a more distinct effect beyond what Stage 1 already accomplishes.





---







-   Applies bridging, corner closing, snapping, etc. to those same contours before finalising into `SharedState.polygons`.

Hence, the second stage is **definitely** using the updated, post-filtered detection results you preview in Stage 1—not bypassing them with any “raw” data.





### REMOVED IDEAS

```REMOVED
#### 1. Orthogonal Bias Is Not Extended Into Stage 2

-   In Stage 1 (`detectElements`), the code runs `orthogonalizeContour()`. This is presumably a big part of “structure and normalise” for architectural elements.
-   In Stage 2, the user might assume it will further refine or “snap” shapes to orthogonal geometry. However, there is no code that systematically re-checks or re-applies a near-vertical/horizontal snap once the contour is approximated or bridged.
-   As a result, if the user is expecting further orthogonal alignment in Stage 2, that is missing.
